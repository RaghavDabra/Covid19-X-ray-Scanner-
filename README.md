##Covid 10 Detetction using Xray imaages 

Creating a Web based application  which tells the people about whether the given xray image of the chest is having covid+ or not,  We used a ML model and libraries like tensorflow and h5py.  We can help people by telling them about the their reports in case the doctors are not available to advice and guide them about their given ct scan/ xray. The website is also very easy to use and will help the people in recognising the the patient's report.
